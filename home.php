                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Harp">Sacred Harp</a> is a four-part a capella singing
                tradition from the United States. It takes its name from the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_note">shape note</a> book that we sing from.</p>
                <h3>Sing with us</h3>
                <p>We sing <strong>every Tuesday</strong> from 7&ndash;9pm. We are currently trying to secure a regular venue: check our calendar on the right or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/bristolsacredharp/">Facebook</a> to find out where we are singing.
                </p>

                <p>We sing every <strong>third Sunday</strong> from 2&ndash;4pm at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cRSMgirtCPU9Ywk66">St Anne's Church Hall, Easton, BS5 6JN</a>.

                <p><strong>Everyone is welcome.</strong> We are not a choir: no-one is in charge, we don't rehearse,
                and we don't perform. Everyone who attends sings, loudly and freely, for their own enjoyment.
                You don't need to be able to read music, although by singing with us you will naturally start to learn.
                Any week is good for you to begin &mdash; just turn up!</p>

                <a href="http://ukshapenote.org.uk/">UK Shapenote</a> is the main UK site, and has a calendar of all
                of the regular singings.</p>
