                <p><strong>Everyone is welcome.</strong> We are not a choir: no-one is in charge, we don't rehearse,
                and we don't perform. Everyone who attends sings, loudly and freely, for their own enjoyment.
                Any week is good for you to begin &mdash; just turn up!</p>
